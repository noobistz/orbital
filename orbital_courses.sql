Computer engineers introduce intelligence into every conceivable device --- from the smart phone that you cannot live without, to massive industrial control systems that power economies. They create the electronic systems in a modern car containing dozens of computing systems communicating through a network. They connect the physical world with cyberspace to enhance everything from entertainment to healthcare and the environment. CEG gives you the skills and knowledge to engineer exciting solutions that move as well as change the world.\r\n\r\nA uniquely multi-disciplinary programme, CEG transcends the traditional boundary of computer science and electrical engineering. You will enjoy the resources and opportunities offered by both the host departments: Computer Science and Electrical & Computer Engineering. The curriculum aims to bring real-world problems, solutions, and experiences into the university environment. You will have the opportunity to consolidate your knowledge through a unique Full-Year industrial attachment, and through overseas work or learning experience. With the solid fundamentals that the NUS Computer Engineering degree will give you, only imagination and ambition will be your limits.','soc'),(3,'Computer Science(Algorithms and Theory)','Algorithms and Theory provide foundations for computer science. A theoretical study of machines allows us to determine what in principle can be done by computers and how much resources (for example, time or space) are needed to do a particular task. Algorithm building underlies all computational tasks, and without a proper study and analysis of algorithms, programming efficiently would be next to impossible. This area also provides students knowledge about different models of computation, and how they relate to each other. For example, does availability of random bits help in completing a task faster? There are also various famous open problems, which have received a lot of public attention. For example Clay foundation has announced a million dollar prize for solving the question whether P=NP (see http://www.claymath.org/millennium/).','soc'),(4,'Computer Science(Artificial Intelligence)','Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines. It is important because it affects us in many aspects of our lives: smart appliances (refrigerators, washing machines, ovens, etc), smart web search and commerce like Amazon.com, smart stock trading using AI, cool games and toys (remember the chess-playing program Deep Blue that beat the world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997), help desks, friendly avatars, etc. Bill Gates once said this:','soc'),(5,'Computer Science(Computer Graphics and Games)','Computer-generated images and videos now permeate our daily life. From the entertainment industry (e.g., movies and video games) to the healthcare industry (e.g., 3D ultrasound imaging); from your computing desktop (e.g., displaying a window) to graphing calculator (e.g., plotting a line), computer graphics algorithms are in action to decide what pixel value to display onto the screen, based on the underlying model of the \"world\" and the mathematics and science of geometry, light, color, and mechanics.','soc'),(6,'Computer Science(Computer Security)','As computing systems become increasingly interconnected and more data are available online, the job of securing computer systems and protecting data becomes increasingly challenging. Computer security is growing into the cornerstone of almost every industry, which heavily relies on networked computing systems for communication and management.','soc'),(7,'Computer Science(Database Systems)','Database programming, design, management and administration are among the most promising specialties in an uncertain job market in times of challenges for the economy. The demand for computer scientists and engineers specialised in the database field is high and growing.','soc'),(8,'Computer Science(Multimedia Information Retrieval)','With the proliferation of text and multimedia information, users are now able to find answers to almost any questions on the Web. However, they are often bewildered by the huge amount of information available to them. Information retrieval (IR) involves the processing and analysis of such unstructured information in order to return the most relevant set of information in answer to user\'s queries. In the early days, IR deals only with text and the associated metadata, and successful text-based search engines have been developed and routinely used, such as Google, Yahoo and Bing. Recently more media contents are being shared on the Web such as the images in Flickr and video in Youtube. For effective retrieval of such contents, IR needs to be extended to deal with audio visual contents. As the size of information grows, users are also looking for systems that can provide concise and precise answers to their information needs, and question-answering (QA) is naturally evolved to address this needs. With the widespread use of mobile devices and sensors, we are looking into a future world where huge amount of interconnected information is available, often in real time. As the needs for information evolves, more advanced techniques are needed to analyse text, images and videos. Thus the field cover text processing, natural language processing, multimedia content analysis and retrieval, question-answering, as well as location and live search. SOC faculty members are among world leaders in multimedia information retrieval, and we are researching into next generation of live media search.','soc'),(9,'Computer Science(Interactive Media)','(applicable to cohorts admitted before AY2015-16 only)','soc'),(10,'Computer Science(Networking and Distributed Systems)','The Internet has become an indispensable part of modern life. Whether we are checking the latest news, communicating with friends, or entertaining ourselves with musics and videos, we cannot get away from accessing and interacting with information and applications over the Internet. The Internet has grown explosively into a network interconnection billions of devices.\r\n\r\nThe Networking and Distributed Systems focus area focuses on how such a large scale interconnection of computing devices can be achieved and how these computing devices can work together, often in a distributed manner, to perform computations and disseminate information from one device to another.','soc'),(11,'Computer Science(Parallel Computing)','Microprocessors have enjoyed a period of tremendous advance in terms of speed and design. The famous Moore\'s Law: \"Transistor density doubles in 18 months\" results in a similar improvement in computing speed. The exponential growth of computing speed is almost unmatched by any other techonology in human history. Consider this: \"Computing power increase by an order of magnitude (10x) every _five_ years\"! and the strange fact that \"Today\'s microprocessors sitting in everyone\'s desktops are far more powerful than the most powerful computing 10 years ago.\"','soc'),(12,'Computer Science(Programming Languages)','Programming languages are artificial languages designed to make it easy to create \"programs\" which are the concrete algorithms which the computer executes.','soc'),(13,'Computer Science(Software Engineering)','While programming languages is about how one instructs the computer, software engineering is about methods of designing programs. It is about the craft and science of programming so that the resulting software is correct and reliable. Software engineering is concerned about developing and maintaining software in a systematic, disciplined, and economic way, in short, an engineering approach to the building and maintenance of software. If we consider the complexity of all human created artifacts, for example, one of the greatest technological achievements of the 20th century is considered to be the Apollo 11 Mission to the moon, the complexity of modern day software such as Microsoft Windows dwarfs that of Apollo 11. The more complex a system is, the greater its potential to fail. Software engineering plays a key role to ensure that such software systems are designed to be robust against failure. Given the prevalence of software in all aspects of modern life, from mobile phones to flight control systems to electricity grid control, the practice of software engineering practices have an important impact on our daily life.','soc'),(14,'Computer Science(Visual Computing)','(applicable to cohorts admitted before AY2015-16 only)\r\n\r\nVisual Computing encompasses many aspects of images, videos and graphics, including their creation, manipulation, storage, distribution, analysis, and search. Humans are visual creatures; a large part of our brains is devoted to processing images that our eyes (sensors) pick up. Visual Computing is thus important because it amplifies and aids our natural human ability to understand images and to communicate with them. When you use a digital camera, or watch a YouTube video, or edit your picture with Photoshop, you are reaping the fruits of Visual Computing. When you are immersed in a computer game, or mesmerized by a movie special effect, you are being entertained by Visual Computing. In fact, this field will continue to gain prominence in our daily lives, not only because we produce a tremendous amount of images, videos and graphics everyday, but also because the visual medium is a natural way for humans to interact with other humans, and with computers. SoC offers more than ten modules in Visual Computing. SoC faculty members are among the world leaders in Visual Computing, and their research has generated commercial spin-offs and patents.','soc'),(15,'Information Security','The Bachelor of Computing in Information Security aims to:\r\n\r\nTo provide a broad-based, inter-disciplinary information security undergraduate programme within NUS.\r\n\r\nTo contribute to the national focus on growing the pool of cyber security professionals in Singapore.\r\n\r\nTo produce graduates who are able to understand information security issues and practices from both technical and organisational points of view.\r\n','soc'),(16,'Information System','The four-year IS programme provides a stimulating education that equips students with the ability to integrate infocomm technology fundamentals with domain expertise to develop innovative solutions for organisations. Through projects and case studies that are aligned with industry best practices, students will develop an in-depth understanding of the strategic exploitation of infocomm technology in emerging organisational forms. Students become proficient in the design and development of infocomm solutions and the management of infocomm projects. Such skills are vital in helping students develop careers that are being emphasised in the iN2015 plan, such as techno-strategist, solution architect, and infocomm project manager.\r\n\r\nStudents can also take a specialisation in Electronic Commerce.','soc');
